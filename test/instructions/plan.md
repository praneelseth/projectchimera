# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Initialization
> Set up the environment and understand the specification

- [ ] Read `AGENTS.md` to understand agent behavior
- [ ] Read `docs/conventions.md` to learn patterns and conventions
- [ ] Identify the target workstream checklist file
- [ ] Create a draft `instructions/plan.md` with high-level phases

## Phase 2: Detailed Planning
> Break down implementation into actionable tasks

- [ ] Define Phase 1: Project Setup tasks
- [ ] Define Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation tasks
- [ ] Define Phase 3: Testing and Verification tasks
- [ ] Define Phase 4: Documentation tasks
- [ ] Define Phase 5: Deployment tasks

## Phase 3: Execution Roadmap
> Sequence of work phases and task completion criteria

- [ ] Complete all tasks in Phase 1 before moving to Phase 2
- [ ] Mark parent tasks as complete only when all subtasks are done
- [ ] Record proof (commit hash) for each completed task
- [ ] Update `instructions/plan.md` checklist accordingly
- [ ] Commit changes with Conventional Commits messages

## Phase 4: Review and Polish
> Ensure the plan meets all requirements

- [ ] Verify that each phase has a clear objective
- [ ] Ensure tasks are ordered sequentially where required
- [ ] Confirm that proof requirements are noted
- [ ] Check that the file uses proper markdown formatting
- [ ] Validate that the plan can be read and understood by a new agent

## Phase 5: Finalize
> Prepare for handover

- [ ] Output `PLANNER_DONE` after the checklist is complete
- [ ] Ensure no further actions are required
